    Definition

        Rudimentary script to perform basic control operations on a camera
        connected to the Raspberry Pi.

    Details

        This is a rudimentary script to perform various control operations
        (e. g. change image settings, rotate and zoom) with a camera connected
        to the on-board CSI Camera Connector interface. It comes with a simple
        text-based menu to select the preferred option.

        It was never meant to be an actual project, rather than an experiment.

        Developed and tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.

        Feel free to modify!

    Requirements

        The script requires the Python 2.x framework and the corresponding
        'python-picamera' package which should be available through the
        default repositories. If not, you can find it here:
